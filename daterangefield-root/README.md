# InlineDateRangeField Add-on for Vaadin 8

InlineDateRangeField is a UI component add-on for Vaadin 8 that provides the possibility to select a range of dates. The add-on is based on the same client side widget as InlineDateField. As it extends AbstarctField, it is suitable for data binding with Binder. The selection of range is currently supported by clicks/touch only. Selection works as follows:

If nothing is selected:
- The first click selects the first end of the interval
- The second click selects the second end of the interval. The interval is then highlighted.

If an interval is already selected:
- Clicking outside the interval extends the interval to the selected date
- Clicking on the start date or the end date collapses the interval to only include the date that was clicked
- Clicking inside the interval otherwise sets the end date to the date that was clicked.

The add-on supports setting limits on the possible interval to select from, just as the built-in DateFields.

## Development with Eclipse IDE

For further development of this add-on, the following tool-chain is recommended:
- Eclipse IDE
- m2e wtp plug-in (install it from Eclipse Marketplace)
- Vaadin Eclipse plug-in (install it from Eclipse Marketplace)
- JRebel Eclipse plug-in (install it from Eclipse Marketplace)
- Chrome browser

### Importing project

Choose File > Import... > Existing Maven Projects

Note that Eclipse may give "Plugin execution not covered by lifecycle configuration" errors for pom.xml. Use "Permanently mark goal resources in pom.xml as ignored in Eclipse build" quick-fix to mark these errors as permanently ignored in your project. Do not worry, the project still works fine. 

### Debugging server-side

If you have not already compiled the widgetset, do it now by running vaadin:install Maven target for daterangefield-root project.

If you have a JRebel license, it makes on the fly code changes faster. Just add JRebel nature to your daterangefield-demo project by clicking project with right mouse button and choosing JRebel > Add JRebel Nature

To debug project and make code modifications on the fly in the server-side, right-click the daterangefield-demo project and choose Debug As > Debug on Server. Navigate to http://localhost:8080/daterangefield-demo/ to see the application.

### Debugging client-side

Debugging client side code in the daterangefield-demo project:
  - run "mvn vaadin:run-codeserver" on a separate console while the application is running
  - activate Super Dev Mode in the debug window of the application or by adding ?superdevmode to the URL
  - You can access Java-sources and set breakpoints inside Chrome if you enable source maps from inspector settings.
